# Deep-Fake Detection System

Deepfake Detection System | Powered by ResNeXt + LSTM Technology

[Link to GitHub repository]

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust deepfake detection system leveraging the strengths of both ResNeXt and LSTM neural networks. The system is designed to analyze video and image data to identify manipulated or synthetic content.

## Key Features

*   **ResNeXt Integration:** Utilizes ResNeXt for feature extraction, capturing rich spatial hierarchies within the input data.
*   **LSTM for Temporal Analysis:** Employs LSTM networks to model temporal dependencies in video sequences, crucial for detecting subtle inconsistencies indicative of deepfakes.
*   **Next.js Frontend:** A modern web interface built with Next.js for easy interaction and visualization of detection results.
*   **[Add other features here, e.g., specific datasets used, performance metrics]**

## Technologies Used

*   Python
*   ResNeXt
*   LSTM
*   Next.js
*   [Other libraries/frameworks used, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch]
